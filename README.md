This is a simple 'Click Counter' type game that I made to get some more experience with JavaScript.
The goal of the game is to reach 2000 Clicks.
Along the way you can purchase "Upgrades" using Clicks that you've collected.
These Upgrades make the game easier to play at the cost of some of your progress.
A Red "Bug Counter" will appear over the game area from time-to-time -
Make sure to click the Red Bug within 3 seconds or it will steal 100 Clicks from you.
No Copyright Infringement Intended - This is not an original idea, and many 'Click Counter' games like
this one already exist. I do not claim ownership of this style of game.
